    <!-- Add content based on the provided privacy policy -->
    <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT")
        feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
        browsing
        activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
        implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any
        other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online
        tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised
        version of this privacy notice.</p>
